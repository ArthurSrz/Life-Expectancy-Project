# Life-Expectancy-Project

This project will try to get answers from a dataset containing five variables : 
* the observed country (`country`)
* the year of observation (`year`)
* the Gross Domestic Product (`gdp`)
* the life expectancy at birth of its citizens (`life_exp`)
* the perceived health of the population (`perceived_health`)
