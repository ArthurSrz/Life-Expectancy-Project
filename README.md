# Life-Expectancy-Project

This project will try to get answers from a dataset containing five variables : 
* the observed country (`country`)
* the year of observation (`year`)
* the Gross Domestic Product (`gdp`)
* the life expectancy at birth of its citizens (`life_exp`)
* the perceived health of the population (`perceived_health`)


At first glance, we wonder how such little data can give us interesting insights. Still, if we look a little closer, this little data might have to say some quite unusual things, opposite to media mainstream. That is : GOOD NEWS ! That's what I intend to do : see if these data might contain some happy news about world's evolution trend. 

I will ask the 3 following question to the data : 
1. is life expectancy getting better in every country ? if not, how many countries are left behind ? is the number of leftovers increasing or decreasing over time ?
2. is the population feeling better over time ? 
3. what relationship can we establish between objective wealth and subjective well being over time ?
